<h1>Grice's Maxims Pythonic Edition</h1>
<main>
<p>Which is better verbose paragraphs or lean and on point sentences?
Why communication with other people can sometimes be so hard sometimes, even though we you
are discussing basic things? Why sometimes we get frustrated with other people
speaking?  Why sometimes you lose your marbles when someone else skips steps in
a tutorial, uses incorrect technical term or when someone assumes something to
be true without asserting his assumption? Well in most cases it comes down to
basic psychology during a any transaction verbal, economic or any other.  These
transactions don't even have to be between two people, because we get mad and
frustrated about objects as well. For example your phone dies when it had 25% of battery, 
you probably get mad and say "What a piece of crap, I can't believe 25% of my
battery only lasted few minutes".  You get mad because of these 2 things: first
is <strong>expected outcome</strong>, second is <strong>actual outcome</strong>.  When we <strong>expect</strong> more from a
phone's battery than it can <strong>actually</strong> deliver we get angry!  This paradigm of looking at
transactions extends to various places as well as our daily lives.  One of the places is
language and communication in general.  If someone says one thing and does
another we get angry because we <strong>expected</strong> one thing and <strong>actually</strong> got something entirely
different. One philosopher who tried to tackle this problem was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Grice">Paul Grice</a>
He distilled and abstracted the rules needed for successful communication and
these rules are now called <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/">Grice's Maxims</a> these maxims should help you out
to cooperate better and to understand why sometimes you annoy or get annoyed by
others.</p>

<p>In general these maxims are great, but for me were rather "dry" and hard to
remember while <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">Zen Of Python</a> for some weird reason just sticks in your head.
Thus _Grice's Maxims Pythonic Edition_ was born.  Furthermore _Zen Of Python_ on
its own can be used daily in some life situations.  </p>

<p><strong>1. Quantity</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More informative is better than less informative, although conciseness beats verbosity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2. Quality</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the face of uncertainty refuse the temptation to say things you may think are false</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>if your claim has no supporting evidence it's a bad idea, if your claim
  has supporting evidence maybe its a good Idea</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Provable is better than unprovable</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>3. Relation</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Relevant is better than irrelevant</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>4. Manner</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Certainty is better that obscurity</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clarity is better than ambiguity</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brief is better than lengthy</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Order is better than chaos</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>I hope this short post was useful. These maxims should help you to be a better speaker and listener as long as you will not forget
the reason why you get derailed.  Remember it is easier to change yourself and your
outlook rather then the people around you.  So go try to be a better communicator
by using at least few rules I presented.</p>
