Motyvation

I tried out the recent HASSIO image for my home automation setup. I kinda liked it, but It lacked the flexibility in basic Linux based things like `apt-get install` plus it really had to access the host machines file system since the HASSIO isntance is dockerized in ResinOS container.

But there was one thing that I really liked it was the scripts for installing `Google Assistant` on Linux. So today I will show you can you install `Google Assistant` on `Rasbian`.  The source material for this gulside and steps I took was based on officiall HASSIO [source](https://github.com/home-assistant/hassio-addons/tree/master/google_assistant)
